Use the filter buttons at the top to show:

- **Open** - Active tasks you're working on
- **Completed** - Tasks you've finished
- **Archived** - Tasks you've hidden (preserves open/completed status)

### 3.2 Sorting Tasks
Use the sort dropdown to order tasks within each domain:
- **Manual** - Custom order you set via drag-and-drop (default)
- **Due Date** - Tasks with due dates first, then by soonest date
- **Scheduled** - Tasks with scheduled dates first, then by soonest date
- **Priority** - Highest priority first (3 → 2 → 1)
- **Effort** - Lowest effort first (1 → 2 → 3)
- **Complexity** - Lowest complexity first (1 → 2 → 3)
- **Created** - Newest tasks first

### 3.3 Drag-and-Drop Reordering
In "Manual" sort mode:
1. Grab the drag handle (grip icon) on the left side of a task
2. Drag the task up or down to reorder within its domain
3. Drag the task to a different domain section to move it there
4. A blue line indicator shows where the task will be placed
5. Release to drop - the new order saves automatically

**Visual feedback during drag:**
- The dragged task appears ghosted (50% opacity) in its original position
- A floating preview follows your cursor
- Target domain highlights when you drag a task over it
- Other tasks don't shift during the drag - only a drop indicator line moves

## 8. Tips & Best Practices

- **Use domains to separate concerns** - Keep work tasks in "Attack", personal development in "Learn"
- **Set priorities** - Focus on priority 3 tasks first
- **Use effort/complexity** - When tired, pick low-effort tasks; when focused, tackle complex ones
- **Archive liberally** - Archive completed tasks you no longer need to see; you can always restore them
- **Drag to reorganize** - Use drag-and-drop to quickly prioritize your day's work
